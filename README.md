- ⚡ Fun fact: ..."The Lie" said to "the Truth", "Let's take a bath together, the well water is very nice". "The Truth", still suspicious, tested the water and found out it really was nice
- . So they got naked and bathed. But suddenly, the Lie leapt out of the water and fled, wearing the clothes of the Truth.

The Truth, furious, climbed out of the well to get her clothes back. But the World, upon seeing the naked Truth, looked away, with anger and contempt. Poor Truth returned to the well and 
disappeared forever, hiding her shame. 

Since then, the Lie runs around the world, dressed as the Truth, and society is very happy ... because the world has no desire to know the naked Truth."
